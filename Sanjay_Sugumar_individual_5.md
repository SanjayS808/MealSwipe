### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

Since the application had a lot of changes, merging all of our changes was difficult. Completing the main functionality first and quickly makes it easier for developers to work on functionality that depends on others.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
Our project is a little behind but development will speed up now that a CI/CD pipeline for deployment is completed. 



### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
Our teamwork and communication has improved and we are using Jira more effectively. 



### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I learned a lot about react navigation and routing.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
David did a great job of making sure he was on task and keeping us updated despite being in California.



## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*
We are going to complete the remainder of sprint 1 goals and work harder to make sure we arent behind on sprint 2. The hardest parts of our application are finished.
