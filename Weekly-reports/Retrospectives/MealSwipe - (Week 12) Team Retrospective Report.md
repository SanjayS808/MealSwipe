2. How is the team doing with communication? How will the team adjust going forward? 

Communication has been a bit more pale compared to other weeks and sprints. At this point, we believe every team member knows what they are doing. Nevertheless, there were multiple moments where some team members did not know what they needed to do, which slowed down our overall progress.

3. How is the team doing with time? (Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?) How will the team adjust going forward? 

The project is a week behind. There are some features we would love to add. But now that we are in the evaluation stage, we now have to be critical on what will appear in our Capstone project and what would not.
