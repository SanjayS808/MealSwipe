1. Give yourselves a pat on the back\! List the teamâ€™s accomplishments.

   We are thankful that there are a lot of them\! But the biggest ones were:  
* Fully created and deployed both front-end and back-end of the website.  
* Implemented the swiping feature for the restaurants.  
* Connected the Mock Google Places API to the website to retrieve restaurant information  
* Started rudimentary frontend and UX design.  
* Created a filter feature based on distance and star-rating  
* Created a favorite list that stores all favorite restaurants.  
* Created a trashed list that stores all undesired restaurants.  
    
2. How is the team doing with communication? How will the team adjust going forward? 

   The team is doing a better job with communication compared to the previous retro. Our group chat does get quiet for a few days, but this is expected. There has been no issues with people not knowing what to do and everyone understands the goals of the sprint and the work they need to do.  
     
3. How is the team doing with time? (Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?) How will the team adjust going forward? 

   The overall project is a little behind schedule. There is a fair amount of backlog items, but nothing to be alarmed about. We will have to adjust and concentrate on these backlog items. A very good aspect though is that all of the fundamental tasks are completed, and hopefully all next features and options are fully implemented in a faster way.
