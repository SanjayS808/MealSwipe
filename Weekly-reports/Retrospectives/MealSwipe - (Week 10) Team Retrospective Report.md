1. Give yourselves a pat on the back\! List the team’s accomplishments.

   We are thankful that there are a lot of them\! But the biggest ones were:  
* Able to get the backend working and connected. Everyones local machine can run the backend  
* We have good feedback to work on and our UI is becoming polished  
* Finished google DB implementation and connection with everyone else.  
* Finished AWS price lowdown  
* Started looking into making a mobile device  
* Started working on reshuffle and selection algorithm.  
* Started applying figma layout to the application  
* Finished and created more CI/CD and testing.  
    
2. How is the team doing with communication? How will the team adjust going forward? 

* Communication is fine but we can be communicating more especially moving forward.  
* We are doing a good job of responding when addressed  
  * However, we should start holding each other accountable   
  * And we should communicate more frequently to help remind each other of what needs to be done.


3. How is the team doing with time? (Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?) How will the team adjust going forward?   
* We need to pick up the pace since there were some setbacks this past week (technical difficulties with GitHub)
